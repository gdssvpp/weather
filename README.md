# weather
Here it's a simple weather app with js. Only put ur city, neighborhood or country and let the magic do.. the magic..

Don't forget to put your raincoat and pickup your umbrella or in case of sunny wear ur sunglasses and ur sunscreen. :)

I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, and, obviously an API -> https://openweathermap.org/current <- right here.


**Pablo from the future, don't forget to link images from internet instead images from local**
